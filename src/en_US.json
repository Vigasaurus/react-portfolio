    "bio": "I am an 18 year old Front-End Developer from Coppell, Texas. I am enrolled in Texas A&M Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, Class of '22. I've been interested and drawn to websites and applications and their development for years. Over the past 4 years I have focused on learning through projects. I always felt that it was easier to learn through doing as opposed to watching. I originally only recreated basic games with new programming languages I was learning at the time, now I focus on making interactive and easily-navigable websites with user usability as my top priority. I prefer to work in a team to create minimalistic, yet feature and user-friendly websites and web-based applications. ",
